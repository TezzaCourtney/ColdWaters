1.	(S) TACTICAL SITUATION:
    (S) INTERCEPTED COMMUNICATIONS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT A GROUP OF SSK SUBMARINES ARE DEPLOYING TO THE IRISH SEA TO PERFORM MINELAYING OPERATIONS. THESE REPORTS SEEM TO REFLECT THE POSSIBLE DEPLOYMENT OF KILO OR ROMEO CLASS SSK.

    (S) THEY MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO SUCCEED AS THIS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY HAMPER ANY FUTURE OPERATIONS DURING THE LIBRATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM.

    (S) DEPLOY TO THE IRISH SEA AND HUNT FOR THIS GROUP.

	(S) DESPITE IMMINENT DEPLOYMENT, ESTIMATES SUGGEST THIS MINING OPERATION COULD LAST FROM 1 - 3 DAYS

2.	(S) PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:
    (S) DEPLOY TO IRISH SEA AND DISRUPT THE MINELAYING BY SINKING SSKS
	(S) PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO KILO AND ROMEO CLASSES
